<description> This is a photo project I originally did for school. The goal was to photograph lonely places in Tallinn on film. All of the photos were shot on 35mm film in 2020.
As a part of the project I learned to develop film and make darkroom prints. I took a lot more photos but here is a selection. </description>

<title>Website update</title>
<link>https://emlar.xyz/rss</link>
<guid>https://emlar.xyz/rss</guid>
<description>After a bit of trouble with my web server the website is now back online. I have decided to join the blog and photography section into one big section on the website. I did that because I update the site too rarely and having only one section makes it easier to see if the it's been updated. In addition to that I also am no longer going to update all the different rss feeds - you can find the new rss feed at https://emlar.xyz/rss </description>
