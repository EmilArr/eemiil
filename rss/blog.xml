<title>Website update</title>

<description>After a bit of trouble with my web server the website is now back online. I have decided to join the blog and photography section into one big section on the website. I did that because I update the site too rarely and having only one section makes it easier to see if the it's been updated. In addition to that I also am no longer going to update all the different rss feeds - you can find the new rss feed at https://emlar.xyz/rss </description>
